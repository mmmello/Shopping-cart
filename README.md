## Shopping cart

This is a simple project from my college which simulates a shopping cart.

The program was developed in the Java programming language.

It has the functions add to cart, show cart, and delete an item from the cart.

Each product has id, name, purchase value, sale value, expiration date, and supplier.

Each supplier has a name, telephone number, company registration number, and address.

An address is made up of street, number, zip code, and city.

A product cannot be added to the cart if it is out of date.

The project was developed in the Java language.
